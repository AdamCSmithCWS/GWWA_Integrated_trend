## Integrated spatial trend model for BBS and GWWA surveys

Integrated, spatially explicit trend model for Golden-winged Warblers. Using data from the BBS and a GWWA-specific survey. The species has declined in some portions of it's range to a point where it is very rarely detected during BBS surveys. As a result, there is effectively no new information coming from the BBS to help understand the species trends.

### To Do

1.  generate site-level trajectories that are comparable to observed counts - model assessment

2.  Potentially examine the change in habitat using similar methods to the [Betts et al.](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41559-022-01737-8)paper.

3.  Run the full BBS model for the species using 2021 data.

4.  Generate a GAMYE model that would integrate full BBS time series with the GWWA data (GAMYE_spatial_bbs_CV_integrated.stan).
