## Integrated spatial trend model for BBS and GWWA surveys

Integrated, spatially explicit trend model for Golden-winged Warblers. Using data from the BBS and a GWWA-specific survey.
The species has declined in some portions of it's range to a point where it is very rarely detected during BBS surveys. As a result, there is effectively no new information coming from the BBS to help understand the species trends.



### To Do
code in a leave future out (LFO) cross-validation comparing the two kinds of spatial models (simple iCAR vs BYM on the trends).
