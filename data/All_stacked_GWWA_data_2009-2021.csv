""Unofficial"" surveys by Steve Semanchuk and Liz Skiles indicate that, historically, there likely has been more than one male GWWA in this area. The area is dominated by mature forest with a few shrubby patches and mowed paths--i.e., not typical GWWA habitat. A GWWA nest w/ nestlings was found near the survey location in 2014."

In 2015, it appeared that the area was again being defended by 2 different males. A GWWA nest w/ nestlings was found near the survey location in 2014. Cattle were present throughout the area in 2014 but were not observed in 2015."
